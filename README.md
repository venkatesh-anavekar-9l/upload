GitHub Upload Script
====================

`github_upload` is a command line utility to allow quick uploading of files to non-repo storage on GitHub.

If can be used from within a local repo, or given an explicit repo name to upload to.

In repo:

    $ cd my_local_repo
    $ github_upload file_to_upload

Explicit:

    $ github_upload file_to_upload myname/myrepo

github_upload requires you have Ruby and a few gems installed.  See below for details.

    $ gem install xml-simple mime-types
